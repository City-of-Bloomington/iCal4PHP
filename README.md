# iCal4PHP
iCal library for PHP

This project was intended to be a port of
Ben Fortuna's excellent [iCal4J](https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j) library.
I got as far as building the RRULE handling portion of the library, and it turned out,
that was as much as I needed.

We could extend this in the future, if needed.
